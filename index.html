                    <br> and a whopping 6,491 pound-feet of torque from a fully electric powertrain,

                    The Aston Martin Vulcan was a track-only. <br> The British supercar made its world debut in 2015,
                    <br> powered by a naturally aspirated 7.0-liter V12 <br>that produced 820 horsepower,<br> and limited to just 24 examples worldwide.
                    <br> An even more track-focused AMR Pro model followed, <br> but even the base Vulcan was a pricey commodity,

                     The Ferrari LaFerrari is the most affordable supercars.<br>
                      It’s a bargain compared to the most expensive vehicle here. <br>
